    "Description": "Hi\nAssist with this issue.\nI want to use WebServiceStudio to test a web service. After specifying the location of the end point WSDL file and click get,  the file loads successfully. This i the message I get on the messages.\nInitializing\nGenerating WSDL\nGenerating Proxy\nCompiling Proxy\nGenerated Assembly\nReflecting Proxy Assembly\nReady To Invoke\n\nHowever when I go to the Invoke method, The methods are not displayed. There is nothing displayed. This does not happen on all webservices I want to test. I am able to connect public webservices on the Internet. Other testing tools like SoapUi are able to connect to this webservice.\nWhat do I need to configure on my environment?",
