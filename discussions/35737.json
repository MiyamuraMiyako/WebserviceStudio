When I invoke a method which read a session variable, webserviceStudio crashes beacause the server return a null reference exception. It seems that the session varible does'nt exist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if I use the sendRequest() method (instead of invoke button), it's working fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't unsterstand why it crashes when I use the Invoke button because it's seem that the callback proxy has a CookieContainer object defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo do my test, I use a webservice with 2 methods : PutInSession(key,value) and ReadFromSession(key)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I call PutInSession(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;XX&quot;) using invoke button, it's working fine. But after if I call ReadFromSession(&quot;A&quot;) using invoke button, it crashes.<br>\r\nBut, I hit send button (in request/response tab) it's working.\r\n",
