I have this bug whenever I tried to add a new service contract saying that the path/file name is too long which exceeded 260 characters,\r\n but in fact, I tried to create a name as shortest as possible already and I can confirm that it didn't exceed the limit of 260 characters. Anyone faced this problem before or knowing how to solve it? Please help!</p>\r\n<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>\r\n",
